# Dijkstra's algorithm benchmark

This project aims at benchmarking four programing languages, Python, Java, C++ and Rust using the Dijkstra algorithm.

The program will generate a graph and execute the Dijkstra algorithm with every language on it. The algorithm will be executed many times and the mean time will be recorded. And then that program will reiterate the operation with a bigger graph. Every execution time will be saved in a .csv file.

# Folders

## src

- `src/main.rs` : the main program
- `scr/test.rs` : the unit tests

## src/dijkstra/

The folder with the source code of Dijkstra programs in each four languages.

## output

The folder where the results will be outputted.
